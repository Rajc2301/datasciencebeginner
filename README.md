#Customer Loan Eligibility Checker

Create a simple program that determines whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their credit score and annual income. Use the following criteria:
If credit score is 750 or above and annual income is $50,000 or more, the customer is eligible for a premium loan.
If credit score is between 650 and 749 (inclusive) and annual income is $30,000 or more, the customer is eligible for a standard loan.
If credit score is below 650 or annual income is below $30,000, the customer is not eligible for a loan.Â¶
